  <p>
    Qwan Ki Do or Quan khi Dao is a Vietnamese martial art that was codified in France in 1981. Qwan Ki Do is practiced <br>
    internationally, schools in Asia and Europe. The practice combines the use of hand-to-hand techniques and weapons, <br>
    with moves combined in both formalised combinations, termed Thao Quyen, and freeform settings. Qwan Ki Do includes <br>
    stances, punches, kicks, throws, holds and many other techniques. Weapon moves include the traditional sword art of <br>
    Viet Lon Guom. Practitioners can progress through three levels, called So Dang, Trung Dang and Thuong Dang or Nhap <br>
    Man, Trung Man and Dai Man, at which different coloured belts are worn. As well as improving physical attributes like <br>
    strength and flexibility in adults, the practice has been shown to help promote good mental health in children.
